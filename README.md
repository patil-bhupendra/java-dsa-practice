# 📘 Java DSA & OOPS Practice Repository

This repository contains my **Java practice code** focused on **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)** concepts.  
It is structured **topic-wise** for **clarity, scalability, and interview preparation**.

---

## 🚀 Purpose of This Repository

- Strengthen **core Java fundamentals**
- Practice **DSA problems** with clean implementations
- Understand **OOPS concepts** with practical examples

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Concepts Used

### Programming Language
